    "GET Method:\n",
    "The GET method is used to retrieve information from a server. When a web page is loaded, the browser sends a GET request to the server for the page's HTML, images, CSS, and other resources. The data sent through the GET request is appended to the URL as a query string, which consists of a key-value pair separated by an equals sign and multiple key-value pairs separated by an ampersand (&). Since the data is sent in the URL, the GET method has a limit on the amount of data that can be sent.\n",

    "POST Method:\n",
    "The POST method is used to send data to the server to create or update a resource. Unlike the GET method, the data sent through the POST method is not visible in the URL. Instead, the data is sent in the body of the request. The POST method is commonly used for form submissions, where a user inputs data, and that data is sent to the server for processing. Since the data is sent in the body of the request, there is no limit on the amount of data that can be sent."
