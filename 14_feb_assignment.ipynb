    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreaded programming can be complex and error-prone. Synchronization between threads must be carefully managed to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging: Multithreaded programs can be difficult to debug, as the behavior of the program may depend on the order in which threads are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead: Multithreading introduces overhead in the form of context switching, where the CPU must save and restore the state of each thread. This can reduce overall performance if there are more threads than CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource contention: If multiple threads access the same shared resource simultaneously, they may contend for access, leading to reduced performance or even deadlock."

    "Deadlock occurs when two or more threads or processes are blocked and unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource or lock.
