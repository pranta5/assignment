    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is a minimalistic framework with a small codebase, making it easy to learn and use. It has fewer dependencies than other frameworks, which means it can be used in a variety of environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask provides a lot of flexibility in terms of how you structure your application, as well as how you interact with databases and other libraries. It doesn't impose any particular architecture on your application, allowing you to use your preferred design patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to learn: Flask is easy to learn for developers who are familiar with Python. Its simple syntax and intuitive API make it a popular choice for building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensible: Flask is highly extensible, with a large number of extensions available to add extra functionality to your application. These extensions cover a wide range of areas, from database integration to authentication and authorization."
