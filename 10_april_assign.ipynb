    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes achieved the highest accuracy (88.57%), precision (88.58%), and F1 score (87.85%) among the three variants.\n",

    "Gaussian Naive Bayes performed well but didn't outperform Bernoulli Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher performance of Bernoulli Naive Bayes might be attributed to the nature of the dataset. If the features are more binary in nature, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, which assumes binary features, may be a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multinomial Naive Bayes has lower performance, possibly because it's more suited for datasets with discrete features representing counts or frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes features follow a Gaussian distribution. Despite performing reasonably well, it might not be the best choice if the features significantly deviate from a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption of Feature Independence: Naive Bayes assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class. In real-world data, this assumption may not always hold, which can affect the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Feature Distributions: Each variant of Naive Bayes makes specific assumptions about the distribution of features. If these assumptions are violated, the model's accuracy may be impacted.\n",

    "Difficulty Handling Missing Values: Naive Bayes doesn't handle missing values well, and appropriate preprocessing or imputation is required."

    "\n",
    "In this specific case, Bernoulli Naive Bayes performed the best among the three variants. However, the choice of the best variant depends on the characteristics of the dataset. It's crucial to consider the nature of features and their distribution when selecting a Naive Bayes variant.\n",

    "Feature Engineering: Explore different ways to represent and engineer features to potentially improve the performance of all models.\n",
