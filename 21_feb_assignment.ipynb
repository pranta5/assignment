    "\n",
    "Deploying web applications: Elastic Beanstalk is commonly used to deploy web applications built on popular programming languages like Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and PHP. Developers can upload their code and Elastic Beanstalk will automatically provision the necessary resources, such as compute instances, load balancers, and databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running microservices: Elastic Beanstalk can also be used to deploy and manage microservices, which are small, independent services that can be used to build larger applications. Elastic Beanstalk supports the deployment of Docker containers, which can be used to package microservices and their dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling applications: Elastic Beanstalk makes it easy to scale applications up or down based on demand. It automatically monitors application metrics and adjusts resources accordingly. This means that developers don't have to worry about manually scaling infrastructure or paying for unused resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring and logging: Elastic Beanstalk provides built-in monitoring and logging capabilities that allow developers to track application performance and troubleshoot issues. It integrates with AWS CloudWatch, which provides real-time monitoring and alerts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "use cases for CodePipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous integration: CodePipeline can automatically build, test, and validate code changes every time a new code commit is made to a source code repository. This allows developers to catch bugs and errors early in the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous delivery: CodePipeline can automate the process of deploying code changes to production environments, making it easier and faster to release updates to applications and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-stage pipelines: CodePipeline supports multi-stage pipelines that allow developers to create complex release processes that involve multiple environments, such as development, testing, staging, and production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration with other AWS services: CodePipeline integrates with other AWS services such as CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy, allowing developers to create end-to-end solutions for building and deploying applications."
